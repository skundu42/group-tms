# Circles Group Trust Management Service

Specialized services for Circles protocol trust management:

## CRC Backers App
* Scans Circles **BackingCompleted**/**BackingInitiated** events
* Filters out blacklisted backers
* **Trusts** valid new backers into a group in batches of 50
* Reconciles initiated-but-not-completed processes (resets CowSwap order or creates LBP)
* Optionally notifies Slack when something looks stuck
* Runs once a minute
* Supports dry-run mode to exercise the logic without submitting Safe transactions

## GP CRC App
* Scans Circles **RegisterHuman** events for newly registered avatars
* Cross-checks avatars against the blacklist service and Metri Safe GraphQL data
* Trusts eligible avatars into the configured group in batches (default 10)
* Supports dry-run mode and Slack notifications
* Runs every 10 minutes

## Dublin TMS App
* Scans on-chain **RegisterHuman** logs from the configured contract
* Filters events where `originInviter` is one of a configured allowlist
* Trusts the matching `human` avatars into a configured group
* Supports chunked block scanning, dry-run mode, and Slack notifications
* Runs continuously with configurable poll interval

## OIC App  
* Monitors affiliate group changes and trust relationships
* Reconciles trust between MetaOrg trustees and affiliates
* Supports dry-run mode for testing
* Incremental scanning with configurable refresh intervals
* Batch processing for efficient trust operations

## Requirements

* Node.js **≥ 24**
* A Circles RPC endpoint (e.g. https://rpc.aboutcircles.com/)
* A private key that is the **group service** for the backers group

## What each app does

### CRC Backers App

* Uses a reorg buffer (`CONFIRMATION_BLOCKS`) from chain head
 * From `START_AT_BLOCK` → head:
   * Pulls **BackingCompleted**, filters via blacklist service, dedupes already-trusted backers, and calls
     `trustBatchWithConditions(group, addresses, expiry=max uint96)` in batches of 50
   * Finds **BackingInitiated** without matching completion:
       * If **past deadline** (initiated timestamp + 24h): try `createLBP()`; notify Slack on inconsistent/insufficient states
       * If **before deadline**: try `resetCowswapOrder()` when valid; if already settled, attempt LBP creation
* Logs summaries by default; `VERBOSE_LOGGING` prints debug and tables
* `DRY_RUN=1` skips Safe transactions and only logs what would have been executed
* Keeps running: initial run, then every minute

### GP CRC App

* Walks block ranges from `START_AT_BLOCK` to the safe head (`head - CONFIRMATION_BLOCKS`) and fetches `RegisterHuman` events via `circles_events`
* Deduplicates avatars, checks them against the blacklist in chunks, and verifies a configured Metri Pay safe exists
* Skips avatars without safes or already trusted in `GP_CRC_GROUP_ADDRESS`; trusts the rest in batches (default 10) with retry logic
* Supports dry-run logging, verbose logging, and optional Slack notifications for start, shutdown, and errors
* Runs every 10 minutes

### OIC App

* Monitors **AffiliateGroupChanged** events for trust relationship updates
* Calculates desired trustees by intersecting:
  * Addresses trusted by any MetaOrg trustee
  * Current affiliates in the registry
* Performs batch trust/untrust operations to reconcile differences
* Supports incremental scanning to avoid re-processing old events
* Can run in dry-run mode for testing without making transactions
* Configurable refresh intervals and batch sizes

### Dublin TMS App

* Walks block ranges from `DUBLIN_TMS_START_BLOCK` to `head - DUBLIN_TMS_CONFIRMATION_BLOCKS` (or `DUBLIN_TMS_TO_BLOCK` when set)
* Fetches `RegisterHuman(human, originInviter, proxyInviter)` logs from the fixed invitation module `0x00738aca013B7B2e6cfE1690F0021C3182Fa40B5`
* Filters to events where `originInviter` is in the fixed Dublin inviter allowlist
* Deduplicates `human` addresses, skips already-trusted avatars in `DUBLIN_TMS_ADDRESS`, and trusts remaining avatars in batches
* Supports dry-run logging and startup/shutdown/run-error Slack notifications

## Operational notes

### General
* Make sure the configured Safe owns the appropriate **service** roles and that the signer key belongs to a Safe owner
* Slack notifications are best-effort; failures may throw and crash the process
* Services are designed to fail loudly on errors and require a supervisor to monitor and restart
* Replace placeholder values (`your_private_key_here`, etc.) with actual values in Docker commands

### CRC Backers App
* `CRC_BACKERS_SAFE_ADDRESS` must be the backers group's **service** and the signer key must belong to that Safe
* If you change the factory address, bump `START_AT_BLOCK` accordingly
* Service is stateless and does not store data between runs

### GP CRC App
* `GP_CRC_GROUP_ADDRESS` must match the group you intend to automatically trust new avatars into
* Provide `GP_CRC_SAFE_ADDRESS` plus `GP_CRC_SAFE_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY` unless `DRY_RUN=1`
* `METRI_SAFE_GRAPHQL_URL` is required; add `METRI_SAFE_API_KEY` if the endpoint is restricted
* `DRY_RUN=1` will log intended trust batches without submitting transactions

### OIC App  
* `OIC_SAFE_ADDRESS` must be the OIC group's **service**; the signer key must belong to that Safe
* `OIC_META_ORG_ADDRESS` is required - this is the MetaOrg whose trustees will be monitored
* Use `DRY_RUN=1` for testing without making actual blockchain transactions
* Service maintains incremental state to avoid re-processing old events

### Dublin TMS App
* `DUBLIN_TMS_SERVICE_EOA` should be the group service EOA (defaults to `0x20a3C619De4C15E360d30F329DBCfe5bb618654f`)
* `DUBLIN_TMS_SERVICE_PRIVATE_KEY` must match `DUBLIN_TMS_SERVICE_EOA` when `DRY_RUN=0`
* Set `DUBLIN_TMS_TO_BLOCK` to run a bounded historical backfill
* If `DUBLIN_TMS_TO_BLOCK` is unset, the app follows the chain head with the configured confirmation buffer

### Gnosis Group App
* Fetches registered human avatars and filters out blacklisted addresses
* Calls a relative trust scoring service to rank avatars by configured targets
* Uses a Safe for execution; set `GNOSIS_GROUP_SAFE_ADDRESS` plus `GNOSIS_GROUP_SAFE_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY` for a 1/n Safe owner
* `GNOSIS_GROUP_DRY_RUN=1` (or `DRY_RUN=1`) skips blacklist and scoring service calls while logging the batches that would be requested

### Router TMS
* `ROUTER_SAFE_ADDRESS` must control the router's executor role; signer key must belong to that Safe
* `ROUTER_BASE_GROUP_ADDRESS` determines which base group memberships are required before enabling routing
* Use `DRY_RUN=1` to log planned enablements without sending transactions

### Docker Notes
* The Dockerfile uses `APP_NAME` build argument to determine which app to run
* Environment variables can be passed directly with `-e` flags instead of using `.env` files
* The container runs as the `node` user for security
